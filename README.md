- ⚡ Fun fact: A software developer walks into a bar, orders a beer, and starts staring
-  intently at his drink. After a few minutes, the bartender leans over and says, "Hey,
-  you alright there? You seem to be having a problem with your beer."

The developer sighs and replies, "Yeah, I can't seem to find the bug."
